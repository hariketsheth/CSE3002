                NEW DELHI: The government and the MPs will get a total of only 79.5 hours, around 60% of the scheduled
                sitting hours, for pursuing their legislative agenda and raising issues of immediate public concern in
                the Rajya Sabha during the first half of the Budget session that commences on Monday.
                The pandemic-hit window, already short, may shrink further if the opposition choses to have another go
                at the Pegasus issue in light of a news report claiming that India had bought the spyware from its
                Israeli manufacturer.</p>

                <p>NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi met ahead of the Budget and gave
                    final nod to it. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Budget at 11 a.m. in the Lok
                    Sabha.
                    This is the fourth budget of the Sitharaman at a crucial time when the nation is reeling under
                    pandemic. The public is expecting a big relief and generation of employment opportunities from the
                    government.
                    An IANS-CVoter nationwide tracker poll conducted on the eve of Budget presentation reveals some
                    predictable results. According to the survey, an annual income of Rs 6,25,000 may become completely
                    out of the income tax bracket. That works out to an average monthly income of just above Rs 52,000.

                <p>COIMBATORE: An unidentified man broke open a house at Vellalore in Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu
                    on Monday and stole 20 sovereigns of gold jewellery and Rs 30,000 in cash.
                    The burglary happened in the house of S Ravichandran, 52, of Indira Nagar at Vellalore. Ravichandran
                    and his two sons went for work on Monday morning. His wife, Revathi, and daughter-in-law locked the
                    house around 1 pm and went to their relatives’ home to attend a ritual. When they returned home
                    around 3 pm, they found the front door lock broken open and valuables missing.
                    The family members alerted Podanur investigation wing police inspector Kathirvel who rushed to the
                    spot with his team and held an inquiry. The police collected CCTV footages. Further investigations
                    were on. </p>

                    Google is introducing a new, integrated view for Gmail on the web. Announcing the change via a
                    blog post, the company said that the new view will make it easy to move between critical
                    applications like Gmail, Chat and Meet in one unified location.
                    When enabled, the new navigation menu will allow users to easily switch between inbox, important
                    conversations, and join meetings without having to switch between tabs or open a new window. It
                    adds a new left sidebar with pill-shaped icons for Mail, Chat, Spaces, and Meet. When working in
                    Chat and Spaces, users will be able to view a full list of conversations and Spaces within a
                    single screen, making it easier to navigate to and engage. When in the inbox, users will be able
                    to view the full array of Mail and Label options that are currently available in Gmail
